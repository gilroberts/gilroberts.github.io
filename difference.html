        The focus is on the scares. In general, the big evil is well determined. The audience wants to see, almost in a voyeuristic and morbid way, how the victims lose their lives facing the inevitable.
        In horror, the climax of this confrontation is to escape or to stop the big evil
        Horror movies "horrify" the audience.

        Often times people consider horror and thriller movies to be the same. This is not the case. While a thriller movie can be a horror movie,
        it doesn't necessarily always have to be. Movies like No Country for Old Men or Uncut Gems are considered to be thrillers.
