        Thriller = Tension filled story that's not predictable, where the climax is usually the revealing of the real evil.

        Often times people consider horror and thriller movies to be the same. This is not the case. While a thriller movie can be a horror movie,
        it doesn't necessarily always have to be. Movies like No Country for Old Men or Uncut Gems are considered to be thrillers.
