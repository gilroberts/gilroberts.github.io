        <h2>"Crack is Wack" - 1986</h2>
      <p>
          Inspired by the crack epidemic in New York City in the 1980's, Haring created this street art
          on a handball court at 128th and 2nd avenue. Even though he originally created it without the permission
          of the city, it is now protected by the city.

        <p>
          Keith Haring is known for creating numerous works under the name of "Untitled". If you google

      <h2>"Ignorance=Fear" - 1989</h2>
      <p>
        All of Haring's work has symbolism behind it. There is even a site that breaks down the hidden
        language within his art. This one of course, is less hidden as it speaks its truth loud and clear.
